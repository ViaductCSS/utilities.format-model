// =============================
// Viewport Width Utility Helper Attributes
// =============================

// Viewport Width Utility Helper Attributes are generated via the below mixin to namespace attributes for certain viewports.
// The advantage to this, is it allows a responsive layout to be generated from the attributes added to a certain element.
// Note - Grid__Item class within grids partial, is used to replace any full width helper class.
// Example Use: data-desk="desk-4-12" data-lap="lap-4/6".

// Note - Un-namespaced Classes are also generated and are to be used globally when an elements spacing is consistant across all viewports.
