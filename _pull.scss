// =============================
// Viewport Position Right Utility Helper Attributes
// =============================

// Viewport Position Right Utility Helper Attributes are generated via the below mixin to namespace attributes
// for certain viewports.
// The advantage to this, is it allows position a certain element specifically for a breakpoint which you have defined.
// Example Use - data-desk="pull-4/12" data-lap="pull-4/6".

// Note - Un-namespaced Classes are also generated and are to be used globally when an elements spacing is consistant across all viewports.

@include generate-grid-percentage-batch($property: 'right', $namespace: 'pull');
